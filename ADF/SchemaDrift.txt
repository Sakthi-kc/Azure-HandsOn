SCHEMA DRIFT:
  New columns coming into dataflow can be drifted. Enable "Allow schema drift" in source to read new columns that aren't defined in the definition.
  This allows new data columns to pass till sink and default data type is 'string'. Enable "Infer drifted column type" to automatically infer data type.
  
  Similarly, enable "Allow schema drift" in sink to write new columns that are not defined in projection.
  If this is enabled, make sure to enable "Auto mapping". To explictly map drifted columns, choose map drifted in data preview and use byPosition, byName expression.
