1. To access keyvault value in named values of APIM or configuration of Logic app, access policies have to be granted for the APIM and Logic app.

2. Liquid condition is If..elsif..else

3. Modify variable value inside the policy expression is not possible. 
    Context variable members are read-only as mentioned in docs, and this cannot be changed via expression.

4. set-variable policy can assign a value either a string literal or using a policy expression.
   The policy expression has access only to context variable and hence we cannot directly read backend URL specified using backend id.
